# [Loupe](https://github.com/unikraft/loupe) Results Database

This repository stores the results generated by Loupe as part of Unikraft
development and our [ASPLOS'24 paper]().

The paper provides an analysis of this data set.

## Notes

- Although you technically *can* browse this data set manually with a simple
  text editor (all data is in CSV), we recommend you to use `loupe search`, as
  described in the [main Loupe README](https://github.com/unikraft/loupe).
- This repository also contains OS support descriptions for 11 OSes, all in the
  format `${OS_NAME}.syscalls`.
- Some folders contain data in the format `imported`, e.g.,
  `flask/suite/imported/data`. This was manually imported from runs with Loupe
  that pre-date the database in its current format. Eventually we will re-run
  these with the new Loupe wrapper.
